# ECE298: Wheelchair Speed Controller

This repo is the source C code compatible with the PCB that I designed in *ECE298 - Instrumentation and Prototyping* at the University of Waterloo.

ECE 298 was a lab-based course where we were given a project to complete a prototype for. We had to buy hardware components, design a PCB that was then manufactured for us, solder components onto the PCB and then program it to fulfill our project's design specs.
